# Introduction

`@galacean/editor-ui` is a set of components used to build [Galacean Editor](https://galacean.com) which is an perfessional 3d scene editor in the browser. This package is separated from it, dedicated to building a graphic editor in the browser.

In addition to including some basic components such as `<Button>` or `<Input />`, it also provides some dedicated components like `<ColorPicker />`, `<GradientSlider />`, `<ParticleSlider />`, `AssetPicker` and some hooks to help you build your own graphic editor.

You also could use it to build some plugins for Galacean Editor.

Accessibility is a key part of the package, all components are designed to be accessible. Besides, we also forward the ref to the underlying DOM element to let you control the component directly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @galacean/editor-ui
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can import the components and use them in your application.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@galacean/editor-ui';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button>Galacean Editor</Button>
  );
}
```

Note: You have to keep your application with some **reset css** to make sure the components work correctly. If not you could use `resetStyle()` which exported from `@galacean/editor-ui` to reset the style.

> This package does not use the `z-index` style.

## Acknowledgement

This library would not have been possible without these excellent open-source projects:

- `@stitches/react` CSS-in-JS solution
- `@radix-ui` for building accessibility components
- `@radix-ui/colors` for color system
- `react-colorful` a tiny color picker component
- `colord` for color manipulation
- `@tabler/icon-react` for some icons
